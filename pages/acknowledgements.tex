I would like to thank my advisor Supro for his technical support and his suggestions and ideas. The author of the ADAM challenge, Kimberley, was very responsive and helpful when first using the dataset and evaluating it on the test dataset. I would also like to thank Alessa, Luis and Saif for reading and going over my thesis and being as judgmental as they were without being cynical -- especially Alessa and Luis who also cooked food when I couldn't. I would also like to thank everyone in the IBBM research group for putting up with me using a lot of GPU resources for a while. Finally, I would like to thank my parents for always being there even when I went MIA for a few weeks at a time.
