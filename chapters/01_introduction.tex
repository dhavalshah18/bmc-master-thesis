\section{Background}
An intracranial aneurysm is a bulge located in a blood vessel in the brain. The rupture of an intracranial aneurysm can lead to a parenchymal hemorrhage, or more commonly to an aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) which is a very serious incident that has high case fatality and morbidity rates \cite{Keedy2006}. Unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs) affect approximately $3$-$5 \%$ of the adult population, irrespective of geographical location and/or ethnicity \cite{vlak2011prevalence}. It is seen ever more commonly for certain risk groups; with approximately 10\% prevalence in individuals with a positive family history for aSAH \cite{bor2014long}. The clinical manifestations of UIAs however, are subtle, with only approximately $10$-$15\%$ of intracranial aneurysms being symptomatic \cite{friedman2001small}. 

It is important that UIAs are detected early during screening to allow for a treatment decision to be made. The diagnosis of an UIA is primarily done through the use of three imaging modalities; intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography (IADSA), computed tomography angiography (CTA) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). Previously, IADSA was considered the gold-standard in diagnosis, however MRA does not usually require use of contrast agents, and was preferred for pre-operative cases. More recently, due to the improvements made in the quality of intracranial imaging technologies, the application of CTA and MRA as diagnostic tools has largely increased \cite{Brown2014}. A more thorough comparison and description of these three modalities will be given in Chapter \ref{chapter3}. For management of intracranial aneurysms, the risks of rupture are weighed against the risks associated with intervention, with the three main treatment options being observation, endovascular therapy, and surgical therapy \cite{Keedy2006}. 

\section{Motivation}
Studies have shown that aneurysms can prove to be quite challenging to detect, with $21$-$40\%$ of all aneurysms being missed during diagnostic screenings depending on the education and experience of an observer \todo{ref?}. Detectability of an aneurysm is also highly affected by the size and location of the aneurysm \cite{okahara2002diagnostic}. In clinical practice (using TOF-MRA), aneurysm detection is performed by radiologists searching through the axial slices of the scan, and possibly combining that with multi-planar reconstructions or a 3D volume reconstruction before making 2D size measurements of the aneurysm. 

The speed of clinical workflow could thus be increased with the aid of automatic methods of quantification of UIAs from TOF-MRAs. It is essential however that these methods do not negatively impact human observer detection and measurement accuracy. Segmentation methods with high precision, high reproducibility, and low bias in surgical planning have been shown to directly impact results and automated segmentation of UIAs would enable quantification of aneurysms and may aid the prediction of UIA rupture risk \cite{Taha2015} \todo{results of what}. For example, shape knowledge of an UIA can be used to assess increase in growth and rupture risk, while quantified shape measurements of UIAs can also be useful for models assessing risks of treatment complications \cite{backes2017elapss, ji2016risk}.


\section{Goal}
With the necessity of good segmentation of UIAs laid out, in this thesis the various methods employing deep learning already available will be analyzed and compared. A novel deep learning architecture is also introduced, evaluated and discussed. With the novel method the aim is to focus on reduction of resource usage, and increase in speed, with improvement or little to no effect on accuracy of the resulting segmentation. The novel architecture uses a combination of 2D and 3D to achieve this, and will be discussed in detail in chapter \todo{add label}. Some deep learning architectures are also discussed in chapter \ref{chapter2} that also introduce parts of the novel method. \todo{I think need to be more concise here, and lay out what exactly was achieved?}
