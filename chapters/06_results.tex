The task of segmenting aneurysms in TOF-MRA images is evaluated with the use of three metrics: Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), Modified Hausdorff Distance (MHD) (95\textsuperscript{th} percentile), and Volumetric Similarity (VS). The overlap of the prediction and ground truth segmentation map is evaluated using DSC. Compared to DSC, MHD is a distance metric and is sensitive to the overall shape of the segmentation. As the name implies, VS is a measure that considers volumes of the segmentations to indicate similarity. These are reported for the networks described in Chapter \ref{chapter4} -- DeepMedic, and nnU-Net -- and for Triplanar-Net. The metrics are evaluated using two datasets -- train, and test. The train dataset comprises the publicly available data from the ADAM challenge, and the test dataset the non-publicly available data from the same \cite{Timmins2020}. During training of all networks, the train dataset was randomly split into training and validation sets while ensuring that the distribution of positive to negative scans is maintained. To note, in the results shown in the following sections when referring to the ``train dataset'', this actually means the validation split that was manually taken from the publicly available train dataset as part of the ADAM challenge \cite{Timmins2020}. Therefore the reported results are on cases which each network was not trained on. The results were obtained on the test dataset by submitting docker containers of the method to \citeauthor{Timmins2020}, as the test dataset is not publicly available. The evaluation is done by the authors of the challenge, and the metric results are reported. It is not possible to run the further analyses on the results of the test dataset, and thus these are only evaluated for the train dataset.

Each segmented voxel or connected component of voxels is considered a positive detection. A positive detection corresponding to an aneurysm is considered a true-positive finding, whereas a positive detection not corresponding to an aneurysm was considered a false-positive finding.

The number of parameters of each network, and the inference time for a scan is also reported. Inference time per case is reported without taking into account time required for preprocessing of the data. It should be noted that DeepMedic runs on a Tensorboard backend, whereas the other networks use PyTorch. 

It is also interesting to further analyze the results with respect to each network: results such as the segmentation performance of true UIAs, segmentation performance based on size of UIAs, and performance on negative scans are also assessed. It is not possible to perform these assessments on the test dataset as it is not publicly available, so the reporting is done only on the train dataset. 
 
\section{Metrics}
Results are shown for the segmentation metrics evaluated on the full TOF-MRA volumes in Table \ref{table:metrics_full} for both the train set and the test set. The interobserver results are taken from the study performed by \citeauthor{Timmins2020}, which are found based on measurements made by two separate observers on a subset of the scans. Figure \ref{fig:results} shows the box plots of the segmentation metrics for the evaluated networks.

\section{Further evaluation}

\subsection{Inference}
Inference time and number of parameters of the three network architectures are shown in \ref{table:inference}; inference time is a very dependent result and to attempt to keep it as unbiased and normalized as possible, for all networks inference was done on an NVIDIA P100 GPU under equivalent conditions. The mean inference time is reported in seconds and calculated by taking an average of the time required for the forward pass of the network over all train data.

\begin{table}[h!tp]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{l r r }
		& parameters & mean inference time (s) \\
		\hline
		nnU-Net & 178297920 & 203 \\
		DeepMedic & \textbf{1178100} & 175 \\
		Triplanar-Net & 1478264 & \textbf{35} \\
	\end{tabular}

\end{table}

\subsection{Segmentation results of true UIAs}
For the three networks assessed, the segmentation performance for only true UIAs  was also evaluated, and the results are shown in Table \ref{table:metrics_pos}. This evaluation was only done on the train dataset.

\end{table}

\subsection{Performance on negative scans}
The average false positive count over all scans containing no true UIAs is shown in Table \ref{table:metrics_neg}, along with the false positive count for all scans. These results are only shown for the train dataset.

\begin{table}[h]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{ l  r r r }
		& All scans & Positive scans & Negative scans \\
		\hline
		nnU-Net & \textbf{0.00} & \textbf{0.00} & \textbf{0.00} \\
		DeepMedic & 99.41 & 97.04 & 110.80 \\

\end{table}

\subsection{Sizes of UIAs}
In Figure \ref{fig:DSC_sizes.eps} diameter of the UIAs is split into four quartiles, and a bar plot of the DSC for the three evaluated networks is shown.
