\chapter{3D Aneurysm Segmentation}
Various methods of aneurysm detection using 3D neural networks are evaluated with the dataset obtained from the ADAM challenge. This include the DeepMedic framework proposed in \cite{Sichermann2019}, a standard 3D-UNet architecture \cite{3dunet}, as well as the nnUnet architecture \cite{nnUnet} which received first place in the challenge.
